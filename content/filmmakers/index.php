        <p>Justin Weinstein has been making documentaries for broadcast, theatrical release, and commercial clients for over 10 years.  Most recently, he wrote and edited Being Elmo; A Puppeteers Journey, which won the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 2011, and for which Weinstein and fellow writer/editor Philip Shane were nominated for The Humanitas Prize which honors "film & television writers whose work explores the human condition in a nuanced, meaningful way." Prior to that, Weinstein produced Face Off at Coal River Mountain for Al Jazeera English, and Dirty Business, produced in collaboration with Alex Gibney. Earlier, Weinstein produced numerous projects for ABC News, Peter Jennings Reporting, and PBS, including Hot Politics for Frontline and the ABC special, Last Days on Earth.
